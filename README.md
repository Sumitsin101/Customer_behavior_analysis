# 📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analytics workflow**, starting from loading raw data in Python to delivering business insights through SQL analysis, an interactive Power BI dashboard, and a final presentation report.
The goal of this project is to showcase practical data analysis skills, data cleaning, querying, visualization, and reporting.

---

## 📂 Dataset

* The dataset contains structured business data (such as sales, customers, products, or events).
* Data was initially explored and cleaned using Python.
* Cleaned data was then loaded into a relational database for SQL analysis.



---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

* **Python** – Data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib / Seaborn
* **SQL** – Data analysis using:

  * PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server
* **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard and data visualization
* **Gamma** – Presentation (PPT) creation
